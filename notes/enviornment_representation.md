# Initial enviornment representation

- Motivation
    - We want to create a model $f_{\theta}(\mathcal{X}_0, k, t, \epsilon) = \hat{y} \approx y$ to study the relationship between an initial enviornment $\mathcal{X}_0$, event-relative timestep $t$, and gauge indices $k$ on $\epsilon - y$ (i.e., the difference b/w a rain gauge 1H acc value $\epsilon$ and MRMS 1H QPE $y$)
    - In this doc, we are concerned with how we **represent** the initial enviornmental state $\mathcal{X}_0$
